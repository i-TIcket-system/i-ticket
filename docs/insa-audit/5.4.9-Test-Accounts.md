## 8. Important Notes for Auditors

1. **Demo Mode**: The platform is in demo mode. Payment processing uses simulated TeleBirr transactions. Switch to live mode requires coordination with i-Ticket team.

2. **Rate Limiting**: The platform enforces rate limits. If you encounter 429 errors during testing, wait for the rate limit window to reset (times vary by endpoint: 1-60 minutes).

3. **Database Not Externally Accessible**: PostgreSQL listens on localhost only. No external database connections are possible.

4. **Cloudflare Proxy**: All traffic passes through Cloudflare. Direct IP access is possible but not recommended for accurate security testing.

5. **GPS Testing**: GPS tracking features require a trip in DEPARTED status. The company admin can change trip status for testing purposes.

6. **Guest Booking**: To test guest booking flow, use any Ethiopian phone number (09XXXXXXXX format) without logging in. Proceed through the booking flow and select Demo payment.

7. **Session Duration**: Login sessions last 30 days. For security testing, clear cookies between tests to ensure clean session state.
